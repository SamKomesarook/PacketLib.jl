# PacketLib.jl

Julia library for crafting and capturing packets, with a focus on flexibility and expressiveness. Work with a wide range of protocols, or use it to develop a new one.

**This library is still under development, and should not be used until the first official release.**

Any contributions are welcome, but those necessary for the next release are preferable.
